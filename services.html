				<h2>Penetration testing</h2>
				<p>Not only we do provide manual penetration testing, but also we are proud to offer a unique pentesting solution.</p>
				<p>After a countless number of penetration tests spread across multiple companies, experimenting with numerous security tools (scanners, analysers), we came up with our proprietary solution: <a href=#><strong>T-Sentinel</strong></a>.</p>
				<p>Such solution drastically decreased scanning time, helped with identification of very rare findings and increased positive approach towards the penetration tests.</p>
